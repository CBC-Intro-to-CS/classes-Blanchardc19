# Instructions:

# Make a class called User.

# Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, and then create several other 
# attributes (at least 2 more) that are typically stored in a user profile.

# Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information.

# Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user.

# Create 3 instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.
